# ACME

As part of my internship at **SkanLog**, I completed this project to deepen my understanding of C# fundamentals and core object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

**Key concepts covered in this project:**
- **The four pillars of OOP:**
  - Abstraction
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
- Unit testing
- Abstract vs. virtual methods
- Static members
- Types of relationships
- Reusability in components
- Interfaces
- General/common methods
